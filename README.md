Introduction:

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, the journey from Figma designs to a fully responsive website using React JS is an exciting adventure. This article will guide you through the process, exploring the beauty of React, CSS, and JavaScript, while delving into the art of animation through CSS keyframes.

From Figma to React JS Design:

The transition from Figma to React JS involves more than just code; it's a seamless fusion of creativity and functionality. Begin by initiating your React app with the command:

A folder structure tip for newbies:

When creating folders, adhere to a naming convention â€“ avoid capital letters or hyphens. Instead, use underscores (_). This ensures a clean and consistent structure, making your project more manageable.

Setting Up Your React App:

After app creation, customize your project by deleting the default 'src' folder and crafting your own. Establish the connection between ReactDOM and the public folder's HTML with the following code snippet:


import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'));


The Call to Action (CTA):
Implement a compelling call to action (CTA) on your website to encourage user interaction. Whether it's a signup button or a purchase prompt, a well-designed CTA can significantly impact user engagement.
